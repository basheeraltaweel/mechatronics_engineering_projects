# My Bachelor's Degree Projects

## First Year

As a beginner student at university, I started my first year with basic courses necessary for any undergraduate student. In a statics course, my group and I created a bridge structure designed to carry more than 20 kilograms, with the load elevated from the middle. We followed theoretical calculations provided by the professor, loading it from 20kg to 100kg. We emerged as winners in the first class of mechatronics engineering.

- **Project:** Bridge Structure
- **Objective:** Carry loads from 20kg to 100kg on a bridge
- **Materials:** Determined by the professor
- **Result:** Successful project, winners of the mechatronics engineering class

## Second Year

During the second year, we took a dynamic course and embarked on a projectile motion project. The objective was to prove, through theoretical calculations, that we could hit a specified target using aerodynamic elements such as springs, nails, and aluminum.

- **Project:** Projectile Motion
- **Objective:** Demonstrate hitting a specified target through projectile motion
- **Materials:** Springs, nails, aluminum
- **Result:** Successful demonstration of hitting the target

*Note: This project was based on a dynamic university course.*

## Third Year

The third year involved projects combining CPU and control, immersing us further into mechatronics. The projects included:

1. **Linear and Angular Displacement Measurement:**
   Reading and measuring linear and angular displacement from a potentiometer, displayed on the serial port using Arduino with small accuracy and precision.

2. **Automobile Obstacle Avoidance:**
   Investigating sensing properties like temperature, ultrasonic, LDR sensors, and Bluetooth to connect master and slave systems for automobile obstacle avoidance.

3. **Garage Automatic Gate:**
   Designing an automatic gate for a garage, utilizing sensing properties to automatically open when an object approaches.

4. **Flying Robot:**
   Designing a flying robot controlled online via mobile phone or other devices using a Bluetooth module.

5. **Steering System:**
   Constructing a mobile robot with a steering system using a four-bar mechanism to change directions.

*Note: These projects were based on sensor and systems, theory of machine, mechatronic system design, machine elements, and electrical machines university courses.*
